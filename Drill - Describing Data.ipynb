    "I would choose the mean for the measure of central tendency and the standard deviation for the measure of variance to describe the data. I would choose the mean because mathematically it is more useful when doing statistics, and in this case it falls between both the median and the mode, so it's a bit of a better estimate of the center of those age groups. Also, there aren't a lot of outliers, which is when the mean isn't as helpful. I choose the standard deviation because it is a standardized measure of the variance, which is a more accurate depiction of the spread of the ages."
